# final-Projects-Fall-2024
Turn in your code, report, and any other documents to the github classroom assignment for this final project.

For this project you will program a useful program. This project covers the SLOs for the class:

A. Create programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, records, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables.

B. Create simple recursive functions and procedures.

C. Evaluate tradeoffs in lifetime management (reference counting vs. garbage collection).

D. Explain how abstraction mechanisms support the creation of reusable software components.

E. Create simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.

F. Compare and contrast object-oriented analysis and design with structured analysis and design.

The useful program can be a game, a business app, or any other type of useful application. It can be any game or app, even one that you make up. It can be a terminal application as well, and DOES NOT need to have graphics. You can score 100% on this project with a terminal based application. A good idea would be to create a project like the ones we have been creating in class.

If you choose to use code that you find online, you will need to add your own code to this app or game. Try to make your game or app original by adding features that are new and innovative. And you will nee to properly cite all the code that you wrote in the tutorial, found online, or any code that did not come out of your head.

You will need to add a minimum of 40 lines of substantial code to the app. You will need to CLEARLY site where you wrote the lines of code, in your code as comments. You are responsible to know what EVERY line in your program does, and be able to tell me what it does in DETAIL. If you cannot you will get a 0 for the project.

If you use code from a tutorial, and is not your own, then cite the code appropriately: https://uark.libguides.com/CSCE/CitingCodeLinks to an external site.

You must use the Java programming language, and standards used in this class.

You should create at least 3 different algorithms that are used in your game. You will have to site these algorithms and write them as a series of steps or as a flowchart. You will also need to take a snapshot of the algorithms and paste them into your report.

Your game should use 3, or more, different data structures total. These must be of at least 2 different types of data structures (such as an array and a queue) and they must be used properly. It must make sense to use these types of data structures. You must be able to CLEARLY explain your data structures and why you used them.

You will also create a report that explains:

What your game or app does and how it is useful or entertaining.
Includes at least 3 algorithms as steps or a flowchart, and a snapshot of the algorithms code.
Explains in a paragraph or 3 the algorithms that you created and how they are used in the game or app. How you created them is important, and if you used ChatGPT here you can explain how you used it - ChatGPT should not be able to write your algorithms in their totality.
Discusses the Big O time of these algorithms.
An explanation of the data structures that you used, why you chose them, and how they were used.
Explains a step in the design or development process where you encountered an
opportunity and how you used this.
Explains a step in the design or development process where you encountered an error and how you resolved this.
Explains what you would change or add in the next version of your game or app.
You will present your Programming Project to the class. The presentation should be at least 10 minutes. During the presentation you should:

* Describe your game or app and how it is useful or entertaining.
* Demo the running of your game or app. Code must be visible, so remember to zoom in!
* At least 5 minutes should be spent explaining your code.
* Explain at least 3 algorithms that you wrote in your code, and how you coded them.
* Explain the data structures that you used in your code, and how you coded them.
* Explain what you would change or add in the next version of your  app or game.
* You will present your project the week before finals week. The code for your game or app and report will be turned in via Canvas this same week.

The rubric can be seen in Canvas.

You will upload your code and report to this github classroom assignment by the due date.
